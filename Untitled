I am getting an AttributeError because the GoogleSearch class is not found in the library version I am using.

The Error: module 'google.ai.generativelanguage_v1beta.types.content' has no attribute 'GoogleSearch'

The Solution: Please simplify my code by removing the complex types imports and using the Dictionary Syntax for the tool instead.

Specific Steps:

Remove the from google.ai.generativelanguage_v1beta.types import content line.

Define the tool as a simple dictionary using the key Google Search_retrieval (this is the key that works for this library version).

Correct Code to Apply:

Python

# 1. Define the tool as a simple dictionary
# Note: We use 'google_search_retrieval' which is the compatible key for this library version.
search_tool = { "google_search_retrieval": {} }
2. Initialize the model
model = genai.GenerativeModel( 'gemini-1.5-flash', tools=[search_tool] )


**Task:** Apply this change to `@main.py` and ensure no other broken imports remain.
